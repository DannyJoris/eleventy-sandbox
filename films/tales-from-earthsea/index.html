        <h1 class="film__title">Tales from Earthsea</h1>
        <p>Something bizarre has come over the land. The kingdom is deteriorating. People are beginning to act strange... What&#39;s even more strange is that people are beginning to see dragons, which shouldn&#39;t enter the world of humans. Due to all these bizarre events, Ged, a wandering wizard, is investigating the cause. During his journey, he meets Prince Arren, a young distraught teenage boy. While Arren may look like a shy young teen, he has a severe dark side, which grants him strength, hatred, ruthlessness and has no mercy, especially when it comes to protecting Teru. For the witch Kumo this is a perfect opportunity. She can use the boy&#39;s &#39;fears&#39; against the very one who would help him, Ged.</p>
