        <h1 class="film__title">Ponyo</h1>
        <p>The son of a sailor, 5-year old Sosuke lives a quiet life on an oceanside cliff with his mother Lisa. One fateful day, he finds a beautiful goldfish trapped in a bottle on the beach and upon rescuing her, names her Ponyo. But she is no ordinary goldfish. The daughter of a masterful wizard and a sea goddess, Ponyo uses her father&#39;s magic to transform herself into a young girl and quickly falls in love with Sosuke, but the use of such powerful sorcery causes a dangerous imbalance in the world. As the moon steadily draws nearer to the earth and Ponyo&#39;s father sends the ocean&#39;s mighty waves to find his daughter, the two children embark on an adventure of a lifetime to save the world and fulfill Ponyo&#39;s dreams of becoming human.</p>
